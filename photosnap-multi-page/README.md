## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Photosnap Live Site](https://claystuart.github.io/FrontEnd-Mentor/photosnap-multi-page/starter-code/index.html)

## My process

First I lay out the mobile site. Then I build the tablet site. Finally, I lay out the desktop CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

None -- although this is an interesting project.
